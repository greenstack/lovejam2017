# lovejam2017

This is the repo Deriboy and I are used to make our entry for [LÃ¶veJam 2017](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam). In the end, it became a silly game where you play as a Latter-Day Saint missionary that's trying to keep an eye on his companion while still trying to contact everyone possible. We still work on it on occasion.

# ccGraphMaker
A simple app designed to create the graphs needed to run levels on Compa Chaos. This is included in the repo to help us generate the levels. The first way was by hand, and then one of us said, "I wish there was a program that could do this for us." So we made it.
